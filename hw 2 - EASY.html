    <h1>The Dallas Cowboys are the best in the NFL!</h1>
    <h2> We got some good newbies in the draft. Like the First Round (19th overall pick) was Linebacker Leighton Vander Esch from Boise State Broncos. It is weird to choose a defensive player in the first round, but the Boys know what they're doing!
        <BR> 
            Conner Williams - offensive linebacker.
             Other good picks - Like Western Kentucky Quarterback, Mike White - drafted in the 5th round!! <BR>
    </h2>
    <h3>Dak Prescott is the best rookie quarterback everrr</h3>
    <p>If Ezekiel Elliot can run the ball we're golden this season!</p>
  </header>
  <p>Yeah yeah, yo! we will run that ball!!!....</p>
